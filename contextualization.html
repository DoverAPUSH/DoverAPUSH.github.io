    <H2>Context</H2>
    <p>Just 20 years prior the United States had been pushed into the greatest economic downfall ever seen in the United States</p>
    <p>As a result of this the Federal Government, in an effort to keep jobs even if there was a second downturn, the government created many more agencies.</p>
    <p>Some of these were created during the great depression and these include the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Works Progress Administration often reffered to as the Alphabet Agencies.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Greatest Threat</strong> to democracy at the time the Dreaded <strong>USSR</strong> launched the Sputnik satellite into space on October 4 1957 causing the United States to need a Space Agency.</p>
