    <h1>National Aeronautics and Space Act</h1>

    <p>The <strong>National Aeronautics and Space Act</strong> is the legislation that created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). It was signed into law on July 29, 1958, by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first manmade satellite, Sputnik, in 1957. This event heightened Cold War tensions and led to increased efforts by the United States to advance its space exploration capabilities.</p>

    <h2>Key Provisions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Establishment of NASA as an independent agency of the United States government</li>
        <li>Direction of NASA to conduct civilian space activities for peaceful purposes</li>
        <li>Authorization for NASA to engage in aeronautical and space research, development, and exploration</li>
        <li>Creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Council to advise the President on space policy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legacy</h2>

    <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Act laid the foundation for NASA's role in space exploration and scientific discovery. Over the years, NASA has achieved numerous milestones, including the Apollo moon landings, the Space Shuttle program, and the exploration of Mars and beyond.</p>
